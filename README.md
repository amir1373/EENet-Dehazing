# EENet-Dehazing

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of **EENet**, a dual-domain network that integrates frequency-aware and spatial multiscale features for single image dehazing. The model is trained on RESIDE-6K and fine-tuned on the RB-Dust industrial dataset.

---

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

EENet leverages:
- **Frequency Processing Modules (FPM)** using FFT-based convolution
- **Spatial Processing Modules (SPM)** with residual CNNs
- **Dual-Domain Interaction Modules (DIM)** to fuse frequency and spatial features
- A U-Net-style encoder-decoder structure with skip connections

---

## ðŸ“¦ Pretrained Model

You can download the pretrained model directly from Kaggle using the following command:

```bash
kaggle models instances versions download moshtaghioun/eenet/pyTorch/default/1
```

Unzip the file and place `best_eenet.pth` in your working directory.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

```python
import torch
from model.eenet import EENet

model = EENet()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("best_eenet.pth", map_location="cuda"))
model.eval()

# Input: Tensor of shape [B, 3, 256, 256] normalized to [0, 1]
# Output: Tensor of shape [B, 3, 256, 256] (dehazed output)
```
